As an analyst, I spearheaded the Texas State Government salary analysis project, employing advanced Power BI techniques to comprehensively analyze and visualize salary data. My role involved developing a range of measures to capture key salary metrics, such as agency totals, average annual salaries, monthly salaries, and hourly pay rates. Each measure was designed to provide detailed insights into the compensation structures within the government sector.

By leveraging Power BI's advanced visualization capabilities, I meticulously analyzed total annual salary distributions by ethnicity and gender, uncovering critical disparities and informing targeted diversity and inclusion initiatives. I also created visuals to show average annual salary distributions by ethnicity and gender, offering a thorough view of compensation equity across demographics. Additionally, I examined total annual salary distributions by hiring year, enabling precise forecasting for the next five years and supporting strategic workforce planning.

Through detailed trend analysis, I tracked fluctuations in employee counts by department, offering valuable foresight into future workforce trends and potential staffing shifts. I developed visuals to highlight the top ten agencies by average annual salary, identifying compensation benchmarks and areas for optimization. Furthermore, I pinpointed the highest-paid employees, providing stakeholders with crucial insights into the compensation landscape.

Interactive filters allowed for an in-depth exploration of average hourly pay by ethnicity and gender, promoting transparency and equity within the organization. I also conducted a comprehensive analysis of employee distributions by employment type, including regular full-time, regular part-time, temporary full-time, and temporary part-time positions, enabling tailored workforce management strategies.
